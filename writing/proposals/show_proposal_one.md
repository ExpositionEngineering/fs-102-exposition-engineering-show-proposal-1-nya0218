## üéâ Show Description

Write at least three to five paragraphs that describe the content of the
episode, ensuring that the description is both engaging and informative.

Join in on the conversation about having an Education minor. Learn about the requirements, and listen to some college students give you insight
about the minor your interested in. I will ask a junior that goes here questions about her experience with minoring in education. Some of the
questions will be, is it fun, is it hard, what type of classes do/did you have to take, etc.

I will ask her to show some of the assignements she had to do. For example she is taking a elementary school grade math and has to make 
worksheets and give it to her class to see if they can solve it. She also has to present a whole lesson, as if she is a teacher. I will ask
her to explain the process of doing so and how she feels about doing it.

I will then ask her how she feels about Education being a minor and not a major. And will ask her what she thinks the benefits are of having it
as a minor.

## üì¢ Call to Action

After a person listens to this episode what do you want them to do?

Have a thourogh understanding of having an education minor.

Write at least two sentences that explain the call to action for this episode.

My hope it after an incoming student listens to this episode, they would be able to have an understanding of having an Education minor.
